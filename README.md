This program asks for three coordinate points in order to plot a point in a 3 dimensional plane.
Once 3 points are plotted it will calculate the area of the 2 dimensional triangle formed in this
three dimensional plane.
The program asks for each axis point individually, for example the point (0,0,0)
must be entered as: 0 enter 0 enter 0 enter.
The area is printed rounded to 2 decimal places after the dot.
